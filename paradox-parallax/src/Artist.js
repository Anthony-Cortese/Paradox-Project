          Escher's art depicts a world in which the normal laws of gravity do
          not apply. The architectural structure seems to be the centre of an
          idyllic community, with most of its inhabitants casually going about
          their ordinary business, such as dining. There are windows and
          doorways leading to park-like outdoor settings. All of the figures are
          dressed in identical attire and have featureless bulb-shaped heads.
          Identical characters such as these can be found in many other Escher
          works. In the world of Relativity, there are three sources of gravity,
          each being orthogonal to the two others. Each inhabitant lives in one
          of the gravity wells, where normal physical laws apply. There are
          sixteen characters, spread between each gravity source, six in one and
          five each in the other two. The apparent confusion of the lithograph
          print comes from the fact that the three gravity sources are depicted
          in the same space. The structure has seven stairways, and each
          stairway can be used by people who belong to two different gravity
          sources. This creates interesting phenomena, such as in the top
          stairway, where two inhabitants use the same stairway in the same
          direction and on the same side, but each using a different face of
          each step; thus, one descends the stairway as the other climbs it,
          even while moving in the same direction nearly side by side. In the
          other stairways, inhabitants are depicted as climbing the stairways
          upside-down, but based on their own gravity source, they are climbing
          normally. Each of the three parks belongs to one of the gravity wells.
          All but one of the doors seem to lead to basements below the parks.
          Though physically possible, such basements are certainly unusual and
          add to the surreal effect of the picture.

          The best known examples of Penrose stairs appears in a couple of
          famous lithographs by M.C. Escher and this brings us to Christopher
          Nolanâ€™s Inception, a film that is billed as a story about dreams but
          also delves deeper into our fascination with paradox.
