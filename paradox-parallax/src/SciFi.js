        <h1>Science Fiction Paradox</h1>
        <h2>Time Travel</h2>
        <h4>The Grandfather Paradox</h4>
        <p>
          Imagine a character traveling back in time to kill her grandfather as
          a young woman. Why would she do this? As a screenwriter, the
          possibilities are endless. Maybe her grandfather turned out to be a
          genocidal dictator, or the inventor of glam rock. Who knows? The point
          is, if the grandfather died, then the time traveler’s parents never
          existed — then neither would the time traveller herself. If she didn’t
          exist, then she wasn’t able to go back in time to begin with. And how
          is that possible if she killed her grandfather?
        </p>

        <h4>Examples in film</h4>
        <p>
          Back to the Future (1985) dramatizes this paradox when ‘80s kid Marty
          McFly goes back to the 1950s and “bumps into his parents,” altering
          the trajectory of their relationship, and imperiling Marty, who now
          may never be born. In this scene, Marty literally begins to disappear
          as it seems his parents will never become a couple.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Terminator (1984), when John Connor sends Kyle Reese to the past
          to save his mother, Sarah, from an artificial intelligence network
          that is trying to wipe out John by killing Sarah before he can even
          come into existence. The famous paradox in The Terminator is that Kyle
          becomes John’s father, then dies in the past. But if he dies in the
          past, how is he sent back from the future to rescue Sarah and become
          John’s father?
        </p>

        <h4>A Casual Loop</h4>
        <p>
          A causal loop is an interestingly simple paradox of time travel that
          occurs when a future event is the cause of a past event, which in turn
          is the cause of the future event. Both events then exist in spacetime,
          but their origin cannot be determined. A causal loop may involve an
          event, a person or object, or information.The terms boot-strap
          paradox, predestination paradox or ontological paradox are sometimes
          used in fiction to refer to a causal loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          In layman's terms, it means this: the time traveler is in the past,
          which means they were in the past before. Therefore, their presence is
          vital to the future, and they do something that causes the future to
          occur in the same way that their knowledge of the future has already
          happened. It is very closely related to the ontological paradox and
          usually occurs at the same time.
